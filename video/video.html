            This video was made for a challenge at ISCOM. It is the 24h créa challenge of 2020.
            The 24h créa are made once a year and gather the students of first, second and third
            year. The goal of this challenge is to make a short film in 24 hours. The challenge
            starts at 10 am and the rendering is done at 10 am the next day. We work on it all
            day and all night. The subject which was proposed to us this year was: "make a
            HYMN TO HUMANITY". In this challenge, I was appointed project manager. I wrote
            the script with my team. I was then director and cameraman and assisted for the
            light and the sound by my team. I then realized all the video editing.

            This video was made for the 24h crea challenge of 2019 at ISCOM. The principle of
            this challenge is described under the video « l'humanité". For this challenge, our
            advertiser was Santé Publique France and we had to make a preventive advert to
            prevent from the dangers of alcohol among young people. For this video, I
            participated in the writing of the script and I was then co-actor of the film. Then I
            realized all the editing of the video. Thanks to this short film, we were elected favorite
            of the jury.

            I am currently in my 3rd year at ISCOM Rouen. My studies have allowed me to develop my skills in graphic design and marketing. I will be happy to put them at your service.<br>
            <br>
            I regularly use ADOBE software to realize my creations. I am very comfortable with Adobe Illustrator to create logotypes or advertising visuals, I can also use Photoshop to create. I use Premiere Pro for video editing and Indesign for magazines, graphic charts and files.<br>
