            I am currently in my 3rd year at ISCOM Rouen. My studies have allowed me to develop my skills in graphic design and marketing. I will be happy to put them at your service.<br>
            <br>
            I regularly use ADOBE software to realize my creations. I am very comfortable with Adobe Illustrator to create logotypes or advertising visuals, I can also use Photoshop to create. I use Premiere Pro for video editing and Indesign for magazines, graphic charts and files.<br>
